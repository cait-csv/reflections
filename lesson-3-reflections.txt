1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- working on collaborative project 
- working on different machines

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- give more control to push when commits are a logical size i.e. new feature
