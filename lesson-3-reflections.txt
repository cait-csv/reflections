1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- working on collaborative project 
- working on different machines

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- give more control to push when commits are a logical size i.e. new feature

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- forks: to clone another GitHub users repository via GitHub
- clones: to copy another repository from GitHub or another machine 
- branches: to create different streams (context) for the code 

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- ability to compare changes 
- ability to merge into master at a later state (manually)

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

- I can share, compare and merge my code with other programmers. It would be e	asier using tools as such rather than doing in manually.
