1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It made it easy to compare side-by-side which line of code had differences. 

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

- easy to revert to previous versions (if needed)
- more efficient troubleshooting 
- able to compare,identify and understand changes made in each versions
- ability to compare versions and provide a good view for code optimisation 

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros
- flexibility to adjust commit intervals depending on context 
- in Git, you are able to add comments to each commit 
- ability to run diff commands with Git IDs 

Cons
- forget to follow a logical commit interval, end up making commits that are 'too big'
- computer crashes before you could commit

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

- version control system like Git was made specifically for programmers 
- ability of Git understand the relationship of multiple files to make a program work 

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

- retrieve the git ID from git log 
- use git diff and the two git IDs you want to compare to view the difference in the code 

6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

- it helps save previous and future versions which allows us to backtrack our code and identify which commit first introduced the error/problem 

7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

- basic navigations like: 
	- open/close file
	- check software versions
	- check if software is already installed on my machine 
	- understand how to troubleshoot when software is not installing properly
