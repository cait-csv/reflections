1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

step 1: go to correct directory using: cd {directory pathway}
step 2: type git init 
step 3: use git status to check repository status 
step 4: add files to Git by typing: get add {file name}
hello
2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- working directory (before staging area) is the where draft files are saved but yet to be committed
- staging area is the step before sending commits to repository 

value of having a staging area allows for:
- more control on which files to commit 
- flexibility and efficiency to commit multiple files at ones (ability to commit all files in staging area at once)
- multiple file commits are useful when we have files that relate to each other i.e. index.html and .js files
